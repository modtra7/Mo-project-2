        lore: 'Dwight strove to be one of the cool kids, but never quite had the charisma. Cut by the football team. Ignored by the basketball team. Grades, distinctly below average. One weekend, on a team-building exercise from his dead-end job, his boss led them deep into the woods. Out came the family recipe moonshine. Dwight remembered taking the first sip before waking up late the next morning all alone. A laughing stock once more, Dwight began hiking his way out of the woods. He was never seen again.'

        },
        lore: 'Though Meg excelled at schoolwork, she was prone to flying off the rails. Perhaps it was her mother that instilled the fierce streak in her. Maybe it was her father leaving when she was a baby. Fortunately, an athletics coach encouraged her to channel her misspent energy on the track, a path that led to a college scholarship. When her mother fell ill, Meg decided to give up her athletic dreams to care for her, until one summers day, on a run deep in the woods, Meg simply vanished.'

        lore: 'Ever since Claudette got her first science kit, she loved experiments. Her passion led to an early college scholarship. Chat rooms and forums became her main source of social interaction, answering botany questions under her moniker of Science Girl. One evening, Claudette sought to be close to nature. Within minutes, the once-familiar woods twisted into something unrecognizable, shrouding her in otherworldly fog. She never found her way back. Her forum only started to wonder where she was a week after she stopped posting.'

        lore: "Growing up the son of a wealthy CEO put the weight of the world on Jake Park. Yet neither money nor ambition fulfilled him. The secrecy surrounding his grandfather's legacy drove him on a search for answers -- much to his father's frustration. His quest was a lonely one, and many nights he found himself haunted by questions of identity. Before long, Jake Park was lost to the world, living off the land as a survivalist. That is, until the fog engulfed the forest."

        lore: 'It took two tours in Vietnam, a handful of medals, and an honourable discharge to get William "Bill" Overbeck to stop fighting and try to live a peaceful life. After decades spent drifting aimlessly, Bill woke to find the world he knew was gone. A plague was turning normal people into mindless killing machines. He soon found other Survivors, and together they fled from the infected hordes. In the end, he sacrificed himself to ensure their safety. Bill was left for dead, his body never found.'

        lore: 'Nea grew up in the small town of Hjo in Sweden, veering away from expected normalcy. Her tag -- Mashtyx -- quickly decorated her hometown. Nea made a sport of tagging government buildings, avoiding authorities with nimble agility. She might have gone too far when her friends dared her to tag the abandoned Crotus Prenn Asylum, but Nea was never one to back down from a challenge. She never returned. When police arrived, all they found was her unfinished tag above the door.'

        lore: 'Free from the constraints of a career and enabled by family wealth, David King spent most of his time at the pub, drinking, watching games, and getting into fights. Few knew that he was an occasional "debt collector" or that he fought in clandestine bare-knuckle fight clubs. When David King stopped showing up to the pub, his friends were not surprised. They figured he had finally picked a fight with someone stronger. In a way, they were right.'
