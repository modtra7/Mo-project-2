        lore: "Evan MacMillan admired the way his father ran the Estate. When Archie MacMillan's mental health began disintegrating, Evan protected him from the herd who sought his fortune. No matter what his father asked, Evan would do it. At least, for a time. The workers soon came to realize that the son's cruelty ran even deeper than the father's. They never proved that Evan led over a hundred men into those dark tunnels before detonating the explosives and sealing them to their fate."

Before long, the path to Coldwind Farm was littered with disembowelled carcasses and empty cans of chainsaw motor-oil. '

        lore: 'After her mother died hunting an Elk, Anna disappeared into the Northern woods, losing her humanity with each passing year. She craved a daughter of her own. When families travelled through, only the little girls were spared and taken back to her house. Every time, they would waste away, perishing from cold, starvation, or sickness. Each death plunged Anna further into madness. Villagers spread legends of a figure in the Red Forest: The Huntress, who killed men and ate little girls.'
